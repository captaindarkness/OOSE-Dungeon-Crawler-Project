OOSE-Dungeon-Crawler-Project
============================
INSTALLATION:
â€¦

INTRODUCTION:
The game is a dungeon-crawler in which the player has to get to the end of the castle and kill the boss. But to get there the player will have to defeat the enemies scattered around the castle.
The player will stumble upon challenge rooms, which will pose a challenge to the player but will give awards in the form of precious gold.
To make getting through the castle a little easier, health orbs will be located around the castle to give some health back.
The score system is based on how much gold the player ends up having collected when the defeating the boss.

CONTROLS:
The player will move with the W, A, S, D or arrow keys, and attack with the SPACE:

W / UP = moving up
A / LEFT = moving left
S / DOWN = moving down
D / RIGHT = moving right
SPACE = ATTACK

TECHNICALS:
-	The player attacks are limited to a cool down of 2 seconds to prevent spamming
-	Each coin collected will add 1 to the score
-	Each health orb adds 3 HEARTS
